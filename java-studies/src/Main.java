public class Main {
    // In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
    // NOTE: Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main.

    // The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // NOTE: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        
        //each code statement must end with a semicolon (;)
    }
}
